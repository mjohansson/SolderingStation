Loosen the clips and remove the inner part, turning the inner part like this 
that shows the indentation to the left from the front, then at the bottom 
Mill a 2x1mm path (Dremel), finally some of the pegs at the back 
remove so that the part can be inserted offset by 90 degrees. if
you want to cast epoxy on the left as shown in the picture above (is a 
optical correction).

Hope that helps…

if someone finds the original, he should write it down briefly
